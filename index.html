<h1>Mortgages Performance and Machine Learning</h1>

<p>2020 is proving to be an eventful year for both mortgage defaults and prepayments.  
Rates are at all time lows,  defaults all time highs, and FED purchases are helping grease the tracks for a steady wave of refinancing.
By taking advantage of data that was not available in 2003 or 2008, as well as using statistical techniques that were not available in those years we hope to get a better understanding of what is going on in the market.
Below is sample of our work:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Rates are low and the <a href="one/index.html">FED is helping</a> as much as she can</li>  
	<li><a href="two/index.html">Loan production</a> is strong and steady. For a historical perspective we include a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTTmG3qLQdWgRgT4HDKW8ZlnzFZ6SiuGzAyBnSPg4trl-AVo2f1ccyjCPILXvniYxncsqPlJlCsCxBm/pubhtml">chart</a> of Agency Loan Issuance 2000 until 2020</li>
	<li>We also include the number of <a href="three/index.html">Ginnie Loans</a> paid off by the mortgagor per month. For August we estimated the number of Ginnie Loans to be paid off.</li>    
	<li>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTKxVk-Clw4nWUGWnawTmkmOQkYt63z7M0-AnbdC8tWzbAkddRGnMiNvb3Im6uRnZ4gKVjFE_5m_Z84/pubhtml">results</a> of both our July and August Ginnie Mae speed experiment. In both cases predictions were made from past data.  August predictions included July data.</li> 
	<li>Included is a coupon by coupon summary of our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS78PWu7M2FN0tylpbpKnuFb7cTJ1jv75eHldNWe5fb17HniVBpkhbWTX0ah9BvHPIjFY6ft0hOMyhJ/pubhtml">residuals.</a> Some of our error comes from a month to month change in behavior. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQhwT4MKFU-bX-U6JaNltdiIhaqkI4e6nwnCSdQ8i1JdK0VMRygb00yr3ltvWXTPeW1d7enS0whLJul/pubhtml">Here</a> you can see speeds of Ginnie Pools (and loans) matched by wala for July and August. There is a noticeable increase.</li> 
	<li>Why we are <a href="five/index.html">predicting VPR (Voluntary) and not CPR</a></li>
	<li>Under normal market conditions current coupon is easy to measure. This summer it's been tricky but by looking at what loans are being produced, and at what has paid off we can get a general idea.  Here we display what loans are being created for <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS47d03xxau6PjvjnFKUFzHZoVLE0juY-FZXgxCGCyxLJW8pDdpdlIHEf7ZzOIOP9xiF47eIhrrWGVn/pubhtml">VA</a> 
		and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRwqtL5HgwEEyEtmJFUR-tGh2APS6G2NbJWUR5YiC7xccgp3ZjompztoBCZ5S3ZCKwEo8RJTQXKnsUL/pubhtml">FHA </a>loans for the past six months.  By looking in more detail at DTI / LTV / Credit score a rate sheet can be reversed.  And here we plot S-Curves for <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTvkZ9Afh9140xhUVm8_5di6_ME3qKsTghxxfsoJceFhtXcdzjTNrvRHZQiuG2KmXZzWYRvteGnr-9r/pubhtml">VA</a> 
		and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTDTdJpGe1fJEhjVsWHbH-H0e2Y_rR77BVlNoKtf2PYdy_ccRLERMWYAgDzlrDkZyyX1RtCffOPt89H/pubhtml">FHA</a> loans.</li>
