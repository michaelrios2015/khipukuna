<h1>Mortgages Performance and Machine Learning</h1>

<p>2020 is proving to be an eventful year for both mortgage defaults and prepayments.  
Rates are at all time lows,  defaults all time highs, and FED purchases are helping grease the tracks for a steady wave of refinancing.
By taking advantage of data that was not available in 2003 or 2008, as well as using statistical techniques that were not available in those years we hope to get a better understanding of what is going on in the market.
Below is sample of our work:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Rates are low and the <a href="one/index.html">FED is helping</a> as much as she can</li>  
	<li><a href="two/index.html">Loan production</a> is strong and steady</li>
	<li>We also include an estimate of the <a href="three/index.html">number of loans </a> to be paid off.  </li>
	<li>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTKxVk-Clw4nWUGWnawTmkmOQkYt63z7M0-AnbdC8tWzbAkddRGnMiNvb3Im6uRnZ4gKVjFE_5m_Z84/pubhtml">results</a> of both our July and August Ginnie Mae speed experiment. In both cases predictions were made from past data.  August predictions included July data.</li> 
	<li>Included is a coupon by coupon summary of our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS78PWu7M2FN0tylpbpKnuFb7cTJ1jv75eHldNWe5fb17HniVBpkhbWTX0ah9BvHPIjFY6ft0hOMyhJ/pubhtml">residuals.</a> Some of our error comes from a month to month change in behavior. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQhwT4MKFU-bX-U6JaNltdiIhaqkI4e6nwnCSdQ8i1JdK0VMRygb00yr3ltvWXTPeW1d7enS0whLJul/pubhtml">Here</a> you can see speeds of Ginnie Pools (and loans) matched by wala for July and August. There is a noticeable increase.</li> 
	<li>Why we are <a href="five/index.html">predicting VPR (Voluntary) and not CPR</a></li>
