					<p>2020 is proving to be an eventful year for both mortgage defaults and prepayments.  
					Rates are at all time lows,  defaults all time highs, and FED purchases are helping grease the tracks for a steady wave of refinancing.
					By taking advantage of data that was not available in 2003 or 2008, as well as using statistical techniques that were not available in those years we hope to get a better understanding of what is going on in the market.
					Below are samples of our work:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>Rates are low and the <a href="one/index.html">FED is helping</a> as much as she can</li>  
						<li><a href="two/index.html">Loan production</a> is strong and steady. For a historical perspective we include a <a href="graph/index.html">chart</a> of Agency Loan Issuance 2000 until 2020</li>
						<li>We also include the number of <a href="three/index.html">Ginnie Loans</a> paid off by the mortgagor per month. For August we estimated the number of Ginnie Loans to be paid off.</li>    
						<li>We include both the <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQW8Hd-o2cO3pfH0ADURT3AHXwYMA0jgZNSRaWw1F3y4mKZ3IfONP0AIXrDRzk2nc-xgK12crmU9Wts/pubhtml">prepayments and projections</a> of all Ginnie pools with about 1000 loans (as of July) for the months of June, July and August. Each month is modeled on previous data. We have used each month's residuals to improve the model for the following months.</li>
						<li>Included is a coupon by coupon summary of our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS78PWu7M2FN0tylpbpKnuFb7cTJ1jv75eHldNWe5fb17HniVBpkhbWTX0ah9BvHPIjFY6ft0hOMyhJ/pubhtml">residuals.</a> Some of our error comes from a month to month change in behavior. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQhwT4MKFU-bX-U6JaNltdiIhaqkI4e6nwnCSdQ8i1JdK0VMRygb00yr3ltvWXTPeW1d7enS0whLJul/pubhtml">Here</a> you can see speeds of Ginnie Pools (and loans) matched by wala for July and August. There is a noticeable increase.</li> 
						<li>Why we are <a href="five/index.html">predicting VPR (Voluntary) and not CPR</a></li>
						
						
						<li>For August in September we predicted speeds for every ginnie mae pool. There are over 200,000, too many to display, but we can display the largest 10,000.  Here are the

						We have included many small pools. These increase the residuals due to low loan count issues.   If you would like to see our breakdown by wala or have us compile a CMO please contact us using the email below. </li>
						<li>We can look at just the 30yr multi issuer pools, remove the FED holdings, and estimate the float for the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS2umjNFNhIPiAFZ2KE3Cay72GRle2cVLRXFZspvveDbSySaR666P3mCG8QqTkfi7QfEOJuim8U7srr/pubhtml">roll</a> as well.</li>
						<li>Under normal market conditions current coupon is easy to measure. This summer it's been tricky but by looking at what loans are being produced, and at what has paid off we can get a general idea.  Here we display what loans are being created for <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS47d03xxau6PjvjnFKUFzHZoVLE0juY-FZXgxCGCyxLJW8pDdpdlIHEf7ZzOIOP9xiF47eIhrrWGVn/pubhtml">VA</a>
